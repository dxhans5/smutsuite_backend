## 🫶 For Creators, Hosts, and Service Providers

SmutSuite isn’t just another social app — it’s your personal command center.

✅ **Profiles** — Public and private, fully separate  
✅ **Messaging** — Real-time threads and DMs  
✅ **Bookings** — Set your availability and accept requests  
✅ **Notifications** — Push alerts for requests, messages, and updates  
✅ **Client CRM** — Log notes, emotional state, red flags, and more  
✅ **Geo-controls** — Hide from locals or only show to verified users  
✅ **Multi-role support** — Be a Creator, Host, Admin, or all three

🔒 **Consent-first by design** — you're always in control.

## 💸 For Investors and Partners

**SmutSuite is not a clone.** It’s what platforms like OnlyFans, Calendly, and Stripe *should have been* if they were designed for real-world intimacy-based work.

### What Makes It Different

🧠 **Modular Identity** — One user, many roles, names, and profiles  
📡 **API-Only Core** — Built to power mobile + web from a single source  
📍 **Location-aware Discovery** — You control who sees what, and where  
🗃 **Session Journaling** — Consent, mood, safety state, client history  
🧾 **Admin Infrastructure** — Audit logs, permissions, moderation tools  
🧩 **Not just content** — Built to handle bookings, events, DMs, payments
